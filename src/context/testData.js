Then it's double the Hal with Hal's Hole in One and SteampunkLink explains his issue with golf video games. Then they look at Drakkhen, one of the strangest RPGs to release on the system. Finally, they talk about the SNES's Final Fight port and learn that sometimes two players are better than one.",
